## Proposal
Proposal 009: Governance Metrics Definition

## Decision
The proposal is **approved**. The following metrics will be tracked for governance operations:

1. **Decision Timeliness** – Measure average time to finalize proposals and decisions.
2. **Review Completeness** – Ensure all proposals undergo required review steps.
3. **Stakeholder Satisfaction** – Collect anonymous feedback from involved participants.
4. **Adherence to Core Values** – Track examples where actions align with peace, clarity, and mentorship principles.

## Implementation
- Metrics will be reported quarterly.
- Reviews of the metrics will be recorded in institutional memory.
- Adjustments to metrics may be made only if aligned with PEMTSbrothers’ core principles.

## Notes
- Speed should never compromise clarity or ethical alignment.
- Metrics are tools for reflection, not enforcement.
