## 1. Purpose

This proposal establishes a **formal committee framework** for PEMTSbrothers.

The purpose is to define **what committees are**, **how they operate**, and **their limits**, without immediately activating or appointing any specific committee.

This ensures that future committees are created deliberately, transparently, and in alignment with PEMTSbrothers’ constitutional values and governance principles.

---

## 2. Background and Rationale

As PEMTSbrothers grows, specialized advisory and operational support may be required in areas such as governance, technology, education, ethics, or strategy.

Rather than creating committees ad hoc, this proposal introduces a **clear framework** that:
- Prevents concentration of unchecked power
- Preserves institutional memory
- Allows future expansion without governance confusion

This proposal focuses on **structure, not authority**.

---

## 3. Definition of a Committee

Within PEMTSbrothers, a **committee** is defined as:

- A structured group created for a specific mandate
- Advisory or operational in nature
- Subordinate to the PEMTSbrothers governance process
- Non-sovereign and non-permanent by default

Committees exist to **support governance**, not replace it.

---

## 4. Authority and Limitations

Committees established under this framework:

- SHALL NOT override:
  - The PEMTSbrothers Constitution
  - Governance decisions
  - Recorded institutional decisions
- SHALL operate within clearly defined mandates
- SHALL remain accountable to governance oversight

Committees do not possess independent authority unless explicitly granted through a separate, approved proposal.

---

## 5. Committee Creation Process

No committee is created by this proposal alone.

Committees SHALL be created through:
1. A dedicated proposal specifying:
   - Name
   - Mandate
   - Scope
   - Duration (if applicable)
2. A governance review
3. A formal decision record

Each committee creation is treated as a **separate governance action**.

---

## 6. Dissolution and Suspension

Any committee may be:
- Suspended
- Modified
- Dissolved

Through a governance decision if it:
- Exceeds its mandate
- Becomes inactive
- No longer serves PEMTSbrothers’ mission

Committees are not permanent entities by default.

---

## 7. Transparency and Record Keeping

All committees:
- Must have their creation, mandate, and outcomes documented
- Must maintain records where applicable
- Are subject to institutional memory practices

Relevant records may be mirrored in the `pemts-memory` repository.

---

## 8. Future Activation Clause

This proposal **does not activate any committee**.

Specific committees, including technical, advisory, or educational committees, may be proposed in the future through separate proposals under this framework.

---

## 9. Conclusion

By adopting this committee framework, PEMTSbrothers establishes a stable foundation for future collaboration while preserving governance clarity, accountability, and institutional continuity.

This proposal enables growth **without haste** and structure **without rigidity**.
