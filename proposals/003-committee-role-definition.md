# Proposal 003: Committee Role Definition (Advisory-Only Model)

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2026-02-01

## Context
Following the initialization of governance structures (Proposal 001) and the establishment of committees (Proposal 002), PEMTSbrothers requires a clear and principled definition of **what committees are and are not empowered to do**.

At this early stage of the institution, clarity is essential to prevent role confusion, authority drift, or unintended concentration of power.

This proposal defines committees strictly as **advisory bodies**, aligned with PEMTSbrothers’ values of humility, calmness, mentoring, and long-term institutional integrity.

## Problem Statement
Without an explicit role definition:
- Committees may unintentionally assume executive authority
- Accountability boundaries may blur
- Institutional memory may weaken
- Power may concentrate prematurely

PEMTSbrothers seeks to build systems that outlive individuals, prioritizing wisdom and service over speed or control.

## Proposal
All committees within PEMTSbrothers shall operate under an **Advisory-Only Model**.

Committees are empowered to:
- Study assigned topics or domains
- Conduct research and reflection
- Gather community input where appropriate
- Draft recommendations, reports, or guidance documents
- Submit advisory outputs to governance for review and decision

Committees are explicitly **not empowered** to:
- Make binding decisions
- Execute actions on behalf of PEMTSbrothers
- Control or disburse funds
- Represent PEMTSbrothers as an authority
- Create or enforce policy

## Rationale
This model:
- Preserves calm and trust in early governance
- Prevents authority accumulation
- Encourages mentoring and learning
- Strengthens institutional memory
- Keeps decision-making transparent and reversible

Execution authority remains solely with:
- Explicit governance decisions
- Documented approvals
- Recorded institutional processes

## Future Considerations
This advisory-only model is not permanent by default.

A future proposal may introduce **limited, well-scoped execution authority** for committees once:
- Governance maturity is demonstrated
- Audit and accountability systems are proven
- Institutional trust is well established

Any such change must occur through a separate, recorded governance decision.

## Impact
- Clear boundaries for all committees
- Reduced governance risk
- Strong alignment with PEMTSbrothers’ founding vision
- Improved long-term stability

## Recommendation
Approve this proposal to formally adopt the **Advisory-Only Committee Model** for PEMTSbrothers.
