# Proposal 004: Committee Lifecycle and Creation Process

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2026-02-04

## Context
With governance initialized (Proposal 001), committees established (Proposal 002),
and committee authority explicitly defined as advisory-only (Decision 003),
PEMTSbrothers requires a clear and consistent lifecycle for committees.

Without a defined lifecycle, committees may be created informally, operate indefinitely,
or lack accountability and closure. This proposal introduces a structured,
transparent, and reversible process for committee creation, operation, and dissolution.

## Purpose
To define how committees are:
- Proposed
- Reviewed
- Approved
- Operated
- Reported
- Dissolved

This ensures committees remain aligned with PEMTSbrothers’ principles of
clarity, humility, and non-accumulation of power.

## Proposal

### 1. Committee Proposal
Any committee MUST begin with a written proposal submitted to the governance repository.

Each proposal must include:
- Committee name
- Purpose and scope
- Duration (fixed-term or review-based)
- Expected outputs (reports, recommendations)
- Membership criteria (if any)

### 2. Review Process
All committee proposals SHALL undergo a formal governance review.
The review assesses:
- Alignment with PEMTSbrothers values
- Overlap with existing committees
- Risk of authority creep
- Necessity and proportionality

### 3. Decision and Authorization
Committees are authorized ONLY through a recorded governance decision.
Authorization grants permission to advise, not to execute.

No committee may operate without:
- An approved proposal
- A completed review
- A recorded decision

### 4. Operational Boundaries
Committees:
- Operate strictly in an advisory capacity
- May issue recommendations and reports
- May not enforce decisions or bind the organization

All outputs must be documented and publicly accessible.

### 5. Duration and Review
Committees must have:
- A defined lifespan, OR
- A scheduled review checkpoint

Committees may be:
- Renewed
- Modified
- Dissolved
based on governance review outcomes.

### 6. Dissolution
A committee is dissolved when:
- Its mandate is fulfilled
- Its term expires without renewal
- A governance decision formally dissolves it

Dissolution must be recorded as a decision.

## Expected Outcome
A predictable, accountable committee system that:
- Prevents unchecked growth
- Encourages focused contribution
- Preserves institutional clarity

## Alignment
This proposal aligns with PEMTSbrothers’ vision of
open governance, advisory humility, and generational responsibility.
