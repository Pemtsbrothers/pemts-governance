# Proposal 007 – Technical Automation Workflow

## Background
PEMTSbrothers governance and institutional memory processes have now stabilized with advisory, committee, and mentorship workflows. To maintain calm, ethical, and auditable operations, automation is proposed to handle repetitive and record-keeping tasks.

## Objective
Introduce technical automation to support:
1. Governance workflow reminders.
2. Automatic archival of decisions, reviews, and reflections.
3. Standardized notifications for mentorship sessions and committee meetings.
4. Maintenance of historical integrity in `pemts-memory`.

## Scope
- Only repetitive and auditable tasks will be automated.
- No decision-making authority is delegated to automation; humans remain responsible for approvals.

## Expected Benefits
- Reduce operational overhead.
- Ensure consistency in governance records.
- Support transparency and long-term accessibility.
- Free human members for higher-value strategic tasks.

## Next Steps
1. Draft automation scripts or workflows.
2. Test automation in a controlled environment.
3. Review by governance before full deployment.
