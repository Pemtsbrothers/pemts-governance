# Proposal 008 – Automation Safeguard Framework

## Objective
Define rules, checks, and oversight mechanisms for technical automation workflows within PEMTSbrothers.

## Background
Decision 007 approved the implementation of automation workflows. To ensure these workflows remain aligned with institutional values (calm, ethical, service-oriented), a safeguard framework is required.

## Proposal Details
1. **Auditability:** All automated actions must be logged and recorded in institutional memory.
2. **Human Oversight:** Critical actions require a designated human reviewer before execution.
3. **Rollback Mechanisms:** Automated workflows must have clear rollback procedures for errors or unintended outcomes.
4. **Review Cycle:** Automation rules and performance will be reviewed at least once per quarter.
5. **Value Alignment:** Any automated decision affecting governance or memory must be reviewed against PEMTSbrothers’ core values.

## Expected Outcome
- Reduced risk from automation errors.
- Transparency in all automated processes.
- Alignment of automated actions with governance and institutional principles.
