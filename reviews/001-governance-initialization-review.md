## Purpose of Review
This review exists to reflect on Proposal 001 before any formal decision is made.
It ensures alignment with the founding intent of PEMTSbrothers and confirms that governance is being introduced with care rather than haste.

## Alignment with Foundational Reflections

### Genesis Reflection
Proposal 001 aligns strongly with the Genesis Reflection.
It emphasizes calm processes, transparency, and stewardship over authority.
The proposal treats governance as a living practice rather than a rigid control system.

### First Question
The proposal directly responds to the foundational question:
“How do we build governance and technical systems that remain calm, ethical, and useful even as they grow beyond their creators?”

By prioritizing review cycles, documentation, and memory, the proposal resists drift toward speed and accumulation.

## Observations
- Governance is framed as service, not power.
- Processes are designed to be auditable and humane.
- No irreversible authority is granted prematurely.
- The proposal leaves room for evolution without abandoning original intent.

## Concerns or Risks
No immediate concerns identified at this stage.
The proposal appropriately avoids over-specification and allows learning through practice.

## Review Outcome
This proposal is considered **clear, aligned, and ready for practical adoption**.
A formal decision may be recorded after this review, but immediate decision pressure is not required.

## Review Note
This review itself is part of PEMTSbrothers’ institutional memory.
Future revisions of governance should reference this review to preserve continuity of intent.
