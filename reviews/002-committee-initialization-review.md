Proposal 002: Committee Initialization Framework

## Review Objective
To assess whether the proposed committee framework preserves decentralization, clarity, and institutional calm without introducing premature authority.

## Observations
- The proposal clearly separates committee creation from committee existence.
- No committee is instantiated by default, reducing power creep.
- Emphasis on transparency and time-bound mandates aligns with PEMTSbrothers’ values.

## Strengths
- Prevents unchecked authority accumulation
- Encourages intentional governance growth
- Maintains openness and reviewability
- Aligns with Genesis Reflection principles

## Concerns
- Minimum committee size is not defined
- Reporting cadence is not yet standardized
- No explicit conflict-resolution path is stated

## Recommendations
- Define a minimum of 2 members per committee
- Require periodic written updates (e.g., quarterly or per mandate)
- Clarify how disputes within committees are escalated

## Review Conclusion
The proposal is sound and safe to proceed to decision, provided recommendations are considered during implementation.
