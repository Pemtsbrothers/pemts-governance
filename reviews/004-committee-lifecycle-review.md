# Review: Proposal 004 – Committee Lifecycle and Creation Process

## Proposal Reference
Proposal 004: Committee Lifecycle and Creation Process

## Review Date
2026-02-04

## Summary
This proposal establishes a clear, minimal, and accountable lifecycle
for committees within PEMTSbrothers. It directly addresses risks of
informal committee creation, authority creep, and indefinite operation.

## Strengths
- Clearly separates advisory permission from execution authority
- Introduces mandatory documentation and transparency
- Enforces reversibility through defined dissolution conditions
- Aligns with prior decisions limiting committee power

## Alignment Check
The proposal is consistent with:
- Proposal 002 (Committee Initialization)
- Decision 003 (Advisory-Only Committee Role)
- PEMTSbrothers’ ethos of humility and non-accumulation of power

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Over-proliferation of committees  
  Mitigation: Mandatory review and decision gating

- Risk: Committees becoming permanent by inertia  
  Mitigation: Required lifespan or review checkpoints

## Recommendation
Approve Proposal 004 as written.

No amendments are required at this stage.

## Review Status
Approved
