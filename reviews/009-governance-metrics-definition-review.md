Proposal 009: Governance Metrics Definition

## Review Summary
- Proposal is clear and actionable.
- Metrics cover timeliness, review completeness, stakeholder satisfaction, and adherence to core values.
- Suggest adding a qualitative reflection section to capture insights not easily measured by numbers.

## Observations
1. Decision Timeliness: Ensure not to prioritize speed over quality.
2. Review Completeness: Track skipped reviews and reasons.
3. Stakeholder Satisfaction: Use anonymous feedback to encourage honesty.
4. Adherence to Values: Document examples of value alignment or misalignment.

## Recommendations
- Include a quarterly reflection meeting to discuss metrics in context.
- Maintain institutional memory records of all metric reviews.
- Consider a feedback loop to adjust metrics if they conflict with core principles.
